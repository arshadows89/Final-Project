get the last thing we designed
$("path").last()

use ajax to then retrieve that info and save it to the
database
ask gill how he did ajax on our group project


Need to make a admin login but not have a sign up...
-do it through rails console

create a login
need to make users

only admin can veiw certain pages

sessions controller when loged in needs to redirect to admin page

there needs to be a thing before adming_update_current_work that shows you a list of all the current works instead of just asking you to create a new one

1 project has 1 galery
galery has many pictures
pictures has many galerys (becuase slideshow pictures can be used in other section????)







------------------ FINISH ARCGIS BY END OF WEEK
gil to show me ajax for created slideshow form

Fix delete for slideshow...

Tomorow goals is to navigate to the arcgis api by creating a new project blueprint

follow guide and instead of users do it with projects... This should make it so projects will have a blueprint associated with them

then follow the other guide for gallery

gallaries are nested within each project though...

click update new project icon... from there should show you a list of current project by name and blueprint (kind of like the one from the guide(steal there veiws and css))
by clicking on the blueprint it takes you too the arcgis api where you then edit the blueprint ext...
----------

currently being redirected to root

project model path might be wrong....

to show projects 
<%= image_tag @user.avatar.url %>
<%= image_tag @user.avatar.url(:medium) %>

so projects/new i make a project, which then directs me to that projects index
<%= image_tag @user.avatar.url(:thumb) %>

check card project on how to delete things without refreshing page






Projects will have many rooms / room one project
rooms will have many pictures

Project = blueprint(img)
rooms = room_name / created_path_made_through_tool_bar
pictures = a gallery of pictures


Project.last.rooms



read phone notes

save path so that i can display path later and use it to bring out a slideshow of pictures of the room

how shapes dont scale with image....
ask chris whats that thing called for images

project 48 should show u what u created so far maybe in a fif color though
















path isnt responsive



cant use masonry with arcgis... need to remove arcgis link in application.html.erb
application scss has masonry stuff in it
home index.html.erb has stuff in it also




button that creates the resizable square or circle

test with div image over background image






























change image to path so you dont see the gray border in project_show












On home page I need to list the blueprints
When blueprints clicked opens a new page that shows Just the blueprint
When you click on a room it displays a gallery of images for that room...




For bathroom picture it could show blueprint but with the bathroom highlighted by using the bathroom path!





Should make rooms and add a few pictures to each room to test



background-color rgba(10,10,10,.0)
get rid of border... maybe none
css styling needed to remove it on user show page
