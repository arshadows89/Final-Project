get the last thing we designed

ask gill how he did ajax on our group project


Need to make a admin login but not have a sign up...
-do it through rails console

create a login
need to make users

only admin can veiw certain pages

sessions controller when loged in needs to redirect to admin page

there needs to be a thing before adming_update_current_work that shows you a list of all the current works instead of just asking you to create a new one

1 project has 1 galery
galery has many pictures
pictures has many galerys (becuase slideshow pictures can be used in other section????)




need database for slideshow to store each image...
when i click update slide show button it takes me to a page
add new slideshow up top
list of all slideshows + button to delete them







Project has avatar

------------------
gil to show me ajax for created slideshow form

Tomorow goals is to navigate to the arcgis api by creating a new project blueprint

follow guide and instead of users do it with projects... This should make it so projects will have a blueprint associated with them

then follow the other guide for gallery

gallaries are nested within each project though...

click update new project icon... from there should show you a list of current project by name and blueprint (kind of like the one from the guide(steal there veiws and css))
by clicking on the blueprint it takes you too the arcgis api where you then edit the blueprint ext...
----------

currently being redirected to root

project model path might be wrong....

to show projects 
<%= image_tag @user.avatar.url %>
<%= image_tag @user.avatar.url(:medium) %>

so projects/new i make a project, which then directs me to that projects index
<%= image_tag @user.avatar.url(:thumb) %>
